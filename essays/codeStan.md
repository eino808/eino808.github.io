## Adhering to the Codiing Standard

<div>
  <p> Regarding coding standards, they might appear as minor details in the grand programming scheme. However, my journey in the coding world has shown me its profound importance. They offer arrangement to our code, foster cooperation among designers, and teach good coding habits. Beyond these direct benefits, coding standards are valuable tools for learning programming languages and spotting coding patterns.</p>
  
  <p>I've faced challenges and rewards as I've steered my way through coding with ESLint and IntelliJ. The intricacy of ESLint initially overwhelmed me, but it soon became a practical guide. It pushed me to address my bad coding habits, and I've come to rely on the reassuring green checkmark it provides as a dependable measure of code quality and my growth as a coder.</p>

  <p>Although coding standards might appear insignificant, they form the foundation for disciplined coding and mastery of programming languages. Even though ESLint can be initially intimidating, it ultimately guides us towards becoming more skilled coders. Embracing coding standards opens the door to creating well-structured, easily understandable, and sustainable code, which is especially valuable for early growth.</p>
