## I am not taking Calc IV... 

My interest in studying to become a Software Engineer stemmed from a practical realization. I had honestly thought I wanted to pursue a degree in Mechanical or Civil Engineering but Calculus 4 and Physics 272 said otherwise. Then came CS. I found it super convenient to be in a Zoom call with colleagues or classmates, alt-tabbing in and out of my competitive game while working on code. All jokes aside, with a lifelong passion for video games and anything tech, the choice in Computer Science felt like a natural fit. The thought of being able to sit in a chair, stare at my computer screen, and make a living sounded great! Since I already do this on a daily, minus the money-making part. Pursuing a career in the CS field, specifically Software Engineering sounded like heaven.

## What Do I want? 

As a Software Engineer, I am deeply committed to improving my skill set on a daily basis. I aspire to not only improve my technical skills but also my personal growth. It's pretty cool how the tech world is constantly evolving, and eventually, in the near future, there will be an abundance of new things to pick up and learn. It's not just about climbing the career ladder rather, keeping my brain flowing with relevant and important information that would help me be a better programmer. What inspires me to keep on this path is knowing that what I create could actually make a difference for all sorts of people out there. Job satisfaction, anyone?

The cool thing is you get to work from your computer or laptop, whatever suits your preference. The flexibility extends to your schedule, which is pretty convenient unless you land yourself in a company that has you working 9-5 in the office. With programming and design experience, there's a wide array of job opportunities for yourself. You can take your pick and choose the one that aligns best with your skill set. Freelancing also opens up for fast career progression and by working on these diverse projects for clients you could consistently update and refine your skills.

I am kind of the quiet type at first, but once I really get to know someone, we usually end up forming a tight bond. Speaking of making connections, whether it's with peers or coworkers, is a pretty big deal for me. A positive work environment promotes better results in what you're doing. Building up these relationships with people can lead to solid professional networks, pen gateways to fresh opportunities, and receive feedback or advice. Additionally, having an idea of who and what your competition is can help you step up your game and focus on the areas where you can improve.

Computer Science is seriously wide-ranging, and the possibilities are endless. Having this degree is like holding a ticket to explore whatever catches your eye. AI, Cyber Security, Data processing, and anything that has a relation to CS has been predicted to be our future. The demand for skilled engineers is primed to surge. People will be knocking on their doors for help, smart fixes, techie guidance, and out-of-the-box ideas. It's gonna be quite the ride!
