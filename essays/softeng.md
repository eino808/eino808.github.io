## I am not taking Calc IV... 

My interest in studying to become a Software Engineer stemmed from a practical realization. I had honestly thought I wanted to pursue a degree in Mechanical or Civil Engineering but Calculus 4 and Physics 272 said otherwise. Then came CS. I found it super convenient to be in a Zoom call with colleagues or classmates, alt-tabbing in and out of my competitive game while working on code. All jokes aside, with a lifelong passion for video games and anything tech, the choice in Computer Science felt like a natural fit. The thought of being able to sit in a chair, stare at my computer screen, and make a living sounded great! Since I already do this on a daily, minus the money-making part. Pursuing a career in the CS field, specifically Software Engineering sounded like heaven.

## What Do I want? 

As a Software Engineer, I am deeply committed to improving my skill set on a daily basis. I aspire to not only improve my technical skills but also my personal growth. It's pretty cool how the tech world is constantly evolving, and eventually, in the near future, there will be an abundance of new things to pick up and learn. It's not just about climbing the career ladder rather, keeping my brain flowing with relevant and important information that would help me be a better programmer. What inspires me to keep on this path is knowing that what I create could actually make a difference for all sorts of people out there. Job satisfaction, anyone?

Since you are working from a computer or laptop whatever you prefer, there is flexibility within
