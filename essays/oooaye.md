## BootLeg

Throughout our time with the UI Frameworks module, on many occasions, I have felt like just wanting to curl up into a ball and sit in the corner of my room and cry. Don't get me wrong, the final product is very satisfying, but was it worth it? On a serious note, learning HTML and CSS was like learning an entirely new language. As I was getting the hang of using the underscore functions in our previous module, we got slapped in the face with making websites.

Utilizing the bootstrap function was way too frustrating, and one could say, why not just stick with the simplicity of raw HTML and CSS? Navigating through Bootstrap, with its many classes and syntax, it almost felt like being blindfolded trying to journey through a labyrinth. It's definitely not a cakewalk, especially for one with no experience in the world of web development. Once you do finally figure out that one tricky piece of syntax you were missing, you do feel a sense of accomplishment for what you've created.


## Why it's Better!

When you compare using Bootstrap to just sticking with raw HTML and CSS, Bootstrap can really speed up the website design process, as long as you're comfortable with its many classes. But once you do get through all those classes and (kind of) understand it, Bootstrap makes your code more readable and simplifies the whole process. Without Bootstrap, making CSS styles can quickly become a big old mess, with lots of modifiers and maybe even repeating elements. This can make your code confusing to work with when you're trying to debug, and make your code unreadable. 

Plus, Bootstrap's standardized approach makes sure that your website's styles stay consistent and look good on different devices. Keeping that consistency could prove to be a challenge with raw HTML and CSS, especially as the project becomes more complex.
