## I have a question...

As a professional, knowing the difference between asking smart and not-so-smart questions is crucial. Smart questions are vital for not only Software Engineers but professionals in general. It enables them to work more efficiently by seeking clear concise information and communicating effectively. Additionally, asking intelligent questions demonstrates professionalism and contributes to ongoing personal and career development in the world of software engineering. Who knows, a question you might have had ages ago could have possibly helped someone down the line.
  
In Eric Raymond's Essay ‘[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)’, he provides a concise and effective approach to asking Computer Science related questions on platforms such as StackOverflow. It highlights the significance of demonstrating respect and conducting prior research before bombarding others with questions. Personally, I don't like asking questions because I have social anxiety. However, on the off chance that I do ask a question, I make sure it's an efficient and effective question that others and myself can gain value from.

## Smart Question
[CLICK ME](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77057435/cors-issue-when-accessing-spring-authorization-servers-oauth2-token-from-anoth)
This question provides detailed context about the issue and includes relevant code snippets, the specific error message they are encountering, and the efforts to address the problem. 

Although I honestly have no idea what I'm looking at, the problem is about sharing data securely between different parts of the system, and there seems to be an issue with allowing this sharing. The person asking the question has shared specific error messages and pieces of code they've tried to use to solve the problem. They also mention that it's working for one part of the system but not another which helps narrow down the issue. Given all this information, the God that solves this problem is given a lot of useful information for others to understand and assist with their problem.

## Not-So-Smart Question
[CLICK ME](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46207899/c-sharp-how-to-allow-users-to-input-decimals-as-an-answer)
This question provided is definitely a not-so-smart question. It's not necessarily a bad question its more of an inexperienced question. I might have asked the same question at one point too, but definitely not on StackOverflow.

The original poster seeks advice on allowing user input of decimals in a C# program but lacks context and specificity. It could be improved by offering more details about the code and specific issues faced. It also briefly mentions confusion between decimals and Booleans, which is somewhat unrelated to the initial inquiry. To make it a smarter question, the poster should have provided specific code snippets or described their challenges in greater detail. 

## Or, just use YouTube

Everyone will ask questions. Whether it be smart or dumb, at least one person can gain from it (hopefully). Asking questions regardless of their quality, plays a crucial role in learning, communication, problem-solving, and personal development. While smart questions often lead to more direct and insightful answers, not-so-smart questions can still serve as a means to clarify misunderstandings. The key is to use both types of questions strategically in the right context to achieve your goals.
