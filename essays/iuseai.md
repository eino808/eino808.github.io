## Introduction

In my time with ICS 314, AI was a big player always there for homework or tackling any problem on the horizon. AI's a mixed bag, you know? It's like this super smart buddy, but if you're not careful, it can throw some curveballs. In the education scene today, especially in fields like Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence is shaking up how we learn. On my journey, I've dug into some key AI tools that shaped how I see things, both in the grand scheme and specifically in the world of ICS 314.

## Personal Experience w/ AI
- Experience WODS: 
  
- In-class Practice WODs: I never really leaned on AI for those in-class practice WODs; I liked testing my knowledge. But if I ever got stuck, I'd use it as a reference to tweak and shape my code based on what it offered. But, for the most part, these practice WODs were pretty straightforward to complete given no time constraints and the help we could receive.
