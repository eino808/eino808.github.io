## Introduction

In my time with ICS 314, AI was a big player always there for homework or tackling any problem on the horizon. AI's a mixed bag, you know? It's like this super smart buddy, but if you're not careful, it can throw some curveballs. In the education scene today, especially in fields like Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence is shaking up how we learn. On my journey, I've dug into some key AI tools that shaped how I see things, both in the grand scheme and specifically in the world of ICS 314.

## Personal Experience w/ AI
- Experience WODS: Using AI was never a problem with the experience WODs because it was recommended that you do your best to understand the content and keep retrying until you got a score you were satisfied with. For example, if you got a DNF there's no penalty in trying again to get a better score. If anything, the more you tried the better you would understand the content.
  
- In-class Practice WODs: I never really leaned on AI for those in-class practice WODs; I liked testing my knowledge. But if I ever got stuck, I'd use it as a reference to tweak and shape my code based on what it offered. But, for the most part, these practice WODs were pretty straightforward to complete given no time constraints and the help we could receive.
  
- In-class WODs: During the in-class WODs I would only ever turn to AI if I was completely stumped. For example, in the beginning-ish part of the semester where we learned about underscore functions, I was completely overwhelmed with all this new information and just could not comprehend any of the material we learned so I did use ChatGPT to help me understand the content. Instead of relying on AI to complete my code entirely, my approach was to strive to comprehend the intricacies of why and how the code functioned.
  
- Essays: AI serves as a valuable tool for refining sentence structure and adding that extra flair to your writing. In the context of essay writing for ICS 314, the informal nature of the assignments has allowed me to express my voice without sounding robotic. However, when faced with more formal tasks such as research papers, AI becomes a go-to resource for helping me structure the initial ideas of the paper.
  
- Final project: As of right now, in the beginning phase of our final project there is no need for the use of AI because I could just reference back to our previous experiences to see how and why the code works. But, I can forsee me using it in the future milestones when we get into the nitty-gritty of the functions that we have not learned.
  
- Learning a concept/tutorial: I used AI to try to understand the underscore functions. I just could not grasp the content but when I had ChatGPT break down why and how underscore functions worked, things started falling into place. It gave me a solid foundation, and soon enough, I had a handle on it.
  
- Answering a question in class or Discord: I personally never used ChatGPT to answer a question in class or Discord. If I never had the answer I would kind of second guess myself and wait for someone else to answer to reinforce my understanding of the question. This practice is quite a bad habit of mine but, it serves as a strategy to solidify my comprehension of the question at hand.
  
- Asking or answering a smart question: I have never done this but I could assume using AI to make the question at hand a 'smart' question or just answering a question, proves to be highly beneficial. It's essential to ensure that the approach doesn't come across as silly or dumb.
