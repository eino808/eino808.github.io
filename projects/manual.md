Ever since I was a young boy, I was really into cars. It wasn't until the beginning of this year that I got my first car. It was a manual Honda Civic Si, and I had absolutely no idea how to drive a stick. So my friend and I literally drove it back to Kapolei from the Acura dealership near the airport. It was the funniest and scariest experience ever.
