## Facebook but better
The <a href="https://uhmarketplace.com">UHMarketplace</a>, our final project developed in ICS 314 by a team of five, is an online platform designed for the University of Hawaii community. Utilizing Meteor, MongoDB, React, and Bootstrap, our platform provides an efficient and user-friendly experience for buying and selling items. The UHMarketplace serves as a practical application of our coursework, emphasizing entrepreneurship within a structured framework. Employing Meteor for application development, MongoDB for data storage, React for the front end, and Bootstrap for design, the platform provides an open marketplace accessible to all users

## My Contributions
In my involvement with UHMarketplace, I played a diverse role, contributing in various ways to enhance the overall project. While my engagement covered a spectrum of tasks, my primary focus was on the user interface and styling elements. I dedicated considerable effort to crafting an engaging and user-friendly interface, ensuring that the platform not only functioned seamlessly but also provided an aesthetically pleasing experience for users.

Throughout the project, I also took on the responsibility of working on smaller yet crucial aspects. This included improving the functionalities of various components and addressing and fixing most bugs that arose during the development process. This attention to detail in refining different elements of the platform aimed to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience. These efforts, though seemingly minor, collectively contributed to the overall success of UHMarketplace, showcasing my commitment to both the finer details and the broader user-facing aspects of the project.

## What I learned
This project marked a significant transformation of meteor-template-react, originally a template for kickstarting Meteor application development. Throughout the process, I gained practical knowledge in Meteor, React, and Bootstrap 5. The journey involved delving into testing methodologies, open-source software development, adhering to coding standards, and successfully deploying the application for a global audience.

On a personal growth note, this project became a lesson in self-directed learning. While I had a foundation in the basics from class, the actual implementation introduced new and occasionally perplexing challenges. This experience underscored the importance of staying proactive in my education, fostering a desire to keep pace with my peers.
